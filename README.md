# QR Code
Create a QR code of a text from terminal command line

## Launch the program
Launch the program with python by typing `python qrcode.py` in the program directory from the Terminal command line.

I personally use a shortcut with the short keyword `qrcode` that launches the code from the right directory.

## Use Terminal alias (mac)
Open or create the shell configuration file by typing `open ~/.zprofile` in the userâ€™s home directory.

Add the line: `alias ytb='python /pathtofile/qrcode.py'` with the right path to your file.

Now you can type `qrcode` in the Terminal command line to launch the program.

## Libraries
This program uses qrcode package: `pip install qrcode`
